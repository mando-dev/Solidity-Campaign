# This is my 2nd Blockchain project (more complex than the first)

This is a financial tool to fix an issue that Kickstarter has. Kickstarter is a fund raising web app.

*All tests are included with full notes. I take ALOT of notes so its almost like reading a book lol.
*Many more tests could have been written in Campaign.test.js but these are enough for you to understand. Read me notes/comments on the code!
*The deployments script is its own animal. This is the wallet provider I used: truffle-hdwallet-provider@0.0.3
*Next wraps up React. It adds on to React such as Routing, Server side rendering (important for Ethereum), and Hot module reload (updates code more easily for devs).
*Next docs is on Github. Next helps React build pages.
